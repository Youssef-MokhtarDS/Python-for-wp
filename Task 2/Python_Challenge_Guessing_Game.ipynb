    "\n",
    "2. On all turns, if a guess is\n",
    " * closer to the number than the previous guess return \"Closer!\"\n",
    " * farther from the number than the previous guess, return \"Farther!\"\n",
    " * if a player want to end, he\\she  presses \"E\" key, return \"End Good bye!\"\n",
    "3. When the player's guess equals the number, tell them they've guessed correctly *and* how many guesses it took!\n",
